Hometown Project README
======================

* This project is being completed as a part of the Scrimba Front-end curriculum.
* The object of this project is to build a single web page descriptive of the author's home town.
* This is a solo project with no template provided and with all styles utilised attributable to the author.
* The images used in the web page have been sourced from using single word search terms in Duck Duck Go, or from Google Earth.
* There is no intent for this web page to be used for any commercial purpose, rather its development was a learning project only.
